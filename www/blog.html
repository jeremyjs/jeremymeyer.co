									How to be 30 times as effective
									<span class="date pull-right">6/18/2013</span>
								</h4>
								<p>
									There's a lot of material out there on time management and being efficient. However, there's a bigger issue at hand: being effective. Effectiveness has a much larger impact at the end of the day. While being efficient is being very good at whatever it is that you do, being effective is doing the things that matter; the things that allow you to accomplish your goals with as little work as possible. Whereas efficiency is a set of tactics, effectiveness is a set of strategies. I make it a personal effort to start with the strategies first, then worry about tactics. No matter what your focus is, you can apply this method to help you reach your goals:
									<br/>
								</p>
								<p>
									Step 1: Pick a goal and ask "Why am I doing this?"<br/>
									Step 2: Break it down by asking "What do I need to do?"<br/>
									Step 3: Apply tactics by asking "How do I do it?"<br/>
								</p>
								<p>
									Let me give you an example.
									<br/>
								</p>
								<p>
									Let's say you want to learn a language. First of all, why are you learning the language? Is it for class? Do you want to travel? Are you just learning some French to impress the ladies? Whatever the reason, you should just focus on that: the why. Once you've given yourself a grand purpose, figure out what you need to do to achieve it. For class, that might be by getting A's. For travel, it might be having a conversation with someone, etc. Okay, good. Here's where you need to do a little critical thinking. Instead of just <i>doing</i> something, make a list of things that you think you should do to achieve this goal. Then, try them out for a week. If you are spending time on something and it isn't helping much, <i>stop doing it</i>. Most people just plow forward without giving much thought as to whether their efforts <i>actually matter</i>. The idea here is to apply what's called Pareto's Law, which tells us that the world is unfair. Most of our efforts are fruitless, and most of the results come from the work that is the most effective. I read somewhere that a good programmer can be up to <i>30 times</i> more effective than a mediocre one. Just think if you could be 30 times better at achieving your goals just by choosing the most effective strategies. Go forth and find a better way! But, as Bruce Lee once said, "If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done." Once you have a strategy that works, make it a habit.
